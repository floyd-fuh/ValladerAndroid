ValladerAndroid
===============

Vallader Romansh - German dictionary app for Android. You can type a word in German or Vallader Romansh and it will display some results from web sources (in WebViews).

Ok, here is the deal. I'm usually not programming Android applications, this was a one-shot bored sunday afternoon project and I simply wrote this app for the sake of "something is better than nothing" while I'm learning Vallader Romansh.

The only reason I put it to the public domain is because friends liked it and wanted it, too. You can download the full source code on https://github.com/floyd-fuh/ValladerAndroid .  And I thought it is sad that an entire idiom (and nearly the entire language) has not a single (free) app in the Android play store.

If the app doesn't work for you, I'm sorry but I probably can't help you. Although, feel free to send me git pull requests or fork it or write an iPhone version.
